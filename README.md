# java final: the C10K problem
## Getting Started
Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Project Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
```cpp
.
├── src // the folder to maintain sources
│   ├── http_server.java
│   └── Convolution.java
├── bin // the compiled files
└── lib // the folder to maintain dependencies
    └── opencv_lib
```
> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency
- [opencv 4.8.1](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.8.1)
- openjdk 17.0.9
- ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (default target)
